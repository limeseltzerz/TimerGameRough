Conversion for URP (Universal Render Pipeline)

Step-by-Step Instructions Guide

1 - Create a New Project Using the URP Template

Open Unity Hub.
Create a new project by selecting the “3D (URP)” template.
Ensure the project starts with URP from scratch.

2 -Import Your Asset

In the new URP project, to Assets > Import Package > Custom Package...
Select your asset’s .unitypackage file and click “Import”.

3 -Run the Render Pipeline Converter

Go to the menu: Window > Rendering > Render Pipeline Converter.
In the window that appears:
Enable the relevant options (e.g., Convert Materials, Convert Shaders, Convert Lighting Settings, etc.).
Click the “Convert” button.
Wait for the process to complete. Unity will automatically convert materials and shaders to be URP-compatible.

4 - (Optional) Clear Lighting Data if You See Pink Materials

If, after conversion, you see materials appearing pink (shader error):
Go to Edit > Lighting > Clear Baked Data.
Then, regenerate lighting: Generate Lighting.
